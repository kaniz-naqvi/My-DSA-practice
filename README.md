# DSA Practice Repository

This repository contains my ongoing practice of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**. Every day, I solve new problems to improve my skills. Each problem is saved as a **day-x.js** file to track my progress.

## Table of Contents

- [Days 1-10](#days-1-10)
- [Days 13-23](#days-1-10)
## Days 1-10:
- [**Day 1**](./Day-1.js): Basic Data Structures & Algorithms (e.g., check even numbers, all even numbers between 1-20, find max num in an array)
- [**Day 2**](./Day-2.js): Arrays and Strings (e.g., Remove duplicants from array, reverse a string without using built-in method, find second largest number)
- [**Day 3**](./Day-3.js): Objects and Hash Maps (e.g., Freaquency of characters in a string, most frequent element in an array)
- [**Day 4**](./Day-4.js): Hash Maps (e.g., Find first non repeating character)
- [**Day 5**](./Day-5.js): Recursion (e.g., calculate sum of all numbers 1 to n, reverse a string)
- [**Day 6**](./Day-6.js): Recursion and Iteration (e.g., calculating power of a num using both)
- [**Day 7**](./Day-7.js): Time and Space complexity (e.g., palindrome checker, max sub array)
- [**Day 9**](./Day-8.js): Solved problems on Graphs (e.g., DFS, BFS)
- [**Day 9**](./Day-9.js): Solved problems on Recursion (e.g., Factorial, Fibonacci)
- [**Day 10**](./Day-10.js): Quick Sort (e.g., implement quick sort, compare the performance of quick and merge sort)
- [**Revision day 1**](./revision%20day1-10%20part(1).js): Solved problems on leetcode (e.g., Anagram Check, Palindrome)
- [**Revision day 2**](./revision%20day1-10%20part(2).js): Solved problems on leetcode (e.g., Merge Sorted array, sort in-place using Kadane's Algorithm)

  ## Day 13-23:

### How to Use:
- Each day, a new file `day-x.js` is added, where `x` corresponds to the day number.
- The file contains the solution to a specific problem I tackled that day.
- You can clone this repository and check the progress.

### Why This Format?
- **Table of Contents (TOC)** makes it easier to navigate through different days and topics.
- **Range-based Organization** allows to track progress over longer periods and see patterns in learning.
