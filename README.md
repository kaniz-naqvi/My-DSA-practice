# DSA Practice Repository

This repository contains my ongoing practice of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**. Every day, I solve new problems to improve my skills. Each problem is saved as a **day-x.js** file to track my progress.

## Table of Contents

- [Days 1-10](#days-1-10)

## Days 1-10:
- **Day 1**: Basic Data Structures & Algorithms (e.g., check even numbers, all even numbers between 1-20, find max num in an array)
- **Day 2**: Solved problems on Linked Lists (e.g., Reverse Linked List)
- **Day 3**: Solved problems on Dynamic Programming (e.g., Knapsack Problem)
- **Day 4**: Solved problems on Stacks (e.g., Balanced Parentheses)
- **Day 5**: Solved problems on Queues (e.g., Implement Queue using Stacks)
- **Day 6**: Solved problems on Sorting (e.g., Bubble Sort, Quick Sort)
- **Day 7**: Solved problems on Searching (e.g., Binary Search)
- **Day 8**: Solved problems on Graphs (e.g., DFS, BFS)
- **Day 9**: Solved problems on Recursion (e.g., Factorial, Fibonacci)
- **Day 10**: Solved problems on Strings (e.g., Anagram Check, Palindrome)

### How to Use:
- Each day, a new file `day-x.js` is added, where `x` corresponds to the day number.
- The file contains the solution to a specific problem I tackled that day.
- You can clone this repository and check the progress or contribute if you like.

### Why This Format?
- **Table of Contents (TOC)** makes it easier to navigate through different days and topics.
- **Range-based Organization** allows you to track progress over longer periods and see patterns in your learning.
