# DSA Practice Repository

This repository contains my ongoing practice of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**. Every day, I solve new problems to improve my skills. Each problem is saved as a **day-x.js** file to track my progress.

## Table of Contents

- [Days 1-10](#days-1-10)

## Days 1-10:
- [**Day 1**](./Day-1.js): Basic Data Structures & Algorithms (e.g., check even numbers, all even numbers between 1-20, find max num in an array)
- [**Day 2**](./Day-2.js): Arrays and Strings (e.g., Remove duplicants from array, reverse a string without using built-in method, find second largest number)
- [**Day 3**](./Day-3.js): Objects and Hash Maps(e.g., freaquency of characters in a string, most frequent element in an array)
- [**Day 4**](./Day-4.js): Solved problems on Stacks (e.g., Balanced Parentheses)
- [**Day 5**](./Day-5.js): Solved problems on Queues (e.g., Implement Queue using Stacks)
- [**Day 6**](./Day-6.js): Solved problems on Sorting (e.g., Bubble Sort, Quick Sort)
- [**Day 7**](./Day-7.js): Solved problems on Searching (e.g., Binary Search)
- [**Day 9**](./Day-8.js): Solved problems on Graphs (e.g., DFS, BFS)
- [**Day 9**](./Day-9.js): Solved problems on Recursion (e.g., Factorial, Fibonacci)
- [**Day 10**](./Day-10.js): Solved problems on Strings (e.g., Anagram Check, Palindrome)
- [**Revision day 1](./revision day1-10-part(1).js): Solved problems on leetcode (e.g., Anagram Check, Palindrome)

### How to Use:
- Each day, a new file `day-x.js` is added, where `x` corresponds to the day number.
- The file contains the solution to a specific problem I tackled that day.
- You can clone this repository and check the progress.

### Why This Format?
- **Table of Contents (TOC)** makes it easier to navigate through different days and topics.
- **Range-based Organization** allows to track progress over longer periods and see patterns in learning.
